## Getting Started

To start using Discord Wrapped, follow these steps:

1. Follow the instructions in [installation instructions](INSTALL.md)

2. Download the repository code:
    * `git clone https://github.com/Soups71/discordwrapped.git && cd discordwrapped`

3. Create a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the project. This file will store your bot's secret token. The format of `config.json` should be as follows:

```json
{
    "Token": "MTE***nds",
    "BotPrefix": "!wrapped",
    "DBConn": "mongodb://localhost:27017"
}
```

4. Add Discord Wrapped to your Discord server. For proper functionality, it is recommended to grant the bot Administrator privileges on the server. While restricting permissions might work, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

5. Start the server:
    * `go run cmd/wrapped/main.go <logfile>`



## Current Tasks

The following tasks are in progress or need attention for future improvements:

* Determine the minimal permissions required for the bot's smooth operation.
* Implement thorough error handling, as the current version lacks adequate error management.
* Create a systemd service file and establish a streamlined installation process to automate the setup and execution of the bot.
